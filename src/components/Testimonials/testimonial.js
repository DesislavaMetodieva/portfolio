She has great communication skills making discussing ideas and designs very easy, allowing everybody to put forward their thoughts and making sure everybody has their say. Not only that but she is very skilled at stepping back to look at the project as a whole to ensure the end product fits the initial concept and always takes the user into account.",

      text: "I had the pleasure of teaching Desislava during her 4 month software cohort. During that time, she dis-played a great understanding of JavaScript and front end development technologies. Her proficiency in these areas allowed her to create dynamic and functional web applications and perform exceptionally on a team. Desislava took the lead on group projects in both technical and organizational aspects and built strong projects that showcased her frontend web development abilities. Additionally, her dedication, positive attitude, and collaborative approach make her a valuable addition to any team or organization. I highly recommend Desislava and am confident that she will continue to excel in her future endeavors.",
